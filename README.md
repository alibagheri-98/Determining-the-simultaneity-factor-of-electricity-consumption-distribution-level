# Determining-the-simultaneity-factor-of-electricity-consumption-distribution-level
In this repository, we use deep learning approaches to detect the simultaneity factor in electricity consumption distribution levels in Iran. The code for this analysis can be found in the 'article-features.ipynb' file. Please note that the dataset used contains confidential information about electricity consumption in Tehran and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns.
